Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series. In these sections, we witness the political and social tensions that exist within the Watch and how they mirror the larger conflicts in Westeros.\n\nIn the prologue, we are introduced to a group of wildlings, led by Mance Rayder, who are attempting to breach the Wall and invade the Seven Kingdoms. The Watch, commanded by Jeor Mormont, is tasked with stopping them. However, the Watch is plagued by internal conflicts, including corruption, mutiny, and disobedience. We see this when Qhorin Halfhand, a respected member of the Watch, suggests that they should negotiate a peace with Mance and allow the wildlings to pass in exchange for information about their numbers and strength. However, this proposal is met with resistance from some of the Watch's members, including Janos Slynt, who is later sentenced to join the Night's Watch by King Stannis as punishment for his treachery.\n\nThe appendix, which takes place several years after the events in the prologue, reveals that the Night's Watch has continued to struggle with these internal conflicts. King Stannis, who has been exiled to the Wall, demands that the Watch provide him with food, shelter, and soldiers to help him reclaim the Iron Throne. This puts the Watch in a difficult position, as they are sworn to remain neutral in the conflicts of the Seven Kingdoms. However, some members of the Watch, including Catelyn Tully and Pycelle, argue that the Watch should remain true to its traditions and refuse Stannis' demands.\n\nThe tensions within the Watch serve as a microcosm of the broader political and social tensions in Westeros. The Watch, like Westeros, is plagued by corruption, mutiny, and disobedience. The members of the Watch, like the lords and ladies of Westeros, are motivated by their own self-interests and agendas. Some members, like Janos Slynt, are willing to betray their oaths for personal gain, while others, like Qhor\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":19},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# New question\nquery = \"Discuss the symbolic significance of the direwolf’s death by a stag’s antler in the Bran chapter and its implications for the Stark and Baratheon houses.\"\n\n# Get relevant documents (RAG retrieval)\ndocs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)\n\n# Print the retrieved documents to understand the context\nprint(\"Retrieved Documents:\\n\")\nfor doc in docs:\n    print(f\"Document:\\n{doc.page_content}\\n{'-'*50}\")\n\n# Build prompt with the retrieved context\ncontext = \"\\n\".join([doc.page_content for doc in docs])\nprompt = f\"\"\"Answer the following question using the context below.

The direwolf, a symbol of the Starks' power and loyalty, is killed by a stag's antler, which is associated with the Baratheon house through their sigil, a crowned stag. This symbolic encounter highlights the tension and conflict between the two houses, both of whom have suffered losses and betrayals. The direwolf's death also foreshadows the tragic events that will unfold for the Stark and Baratheon houses, as both will face challenges and threats that will ultimately lead to their downfall. The direwolf's death serves as a warning of the danger that lurks in the realm, and the need for the Starks and Baratheons to be cautious and vigilant in the face of adversity.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":25},{"cell_type":"code","source":"questions = [\n    (\"Basic\", \"What is the name of the sword used by Eddard Stark in the execution scene?\"),\n    (\"Intermediate\", \"What is the relationship between Jon Snow and Robb Stark, and how is it reflected in their interaction during the direwolf pup scene?\"),\n    (\"Advanced\", \"Discuss the role of the Night’s Watch in the prologue and appendix, and how it serves as a microcosm of the broader political and social tensions in Westeros.\"),\n    (\"Edge Case\", \"Who is the leader of House Tully during the events of the Bran chapter, and what is their relationship to Catelyn Stark?\"),\n    (\"Out-of-Context\", \"Does the Sorting Hat play a role in determining the houses of Westeros, such as House Stark or House Lannister?\")\n]\n\n# Loop through each question\nfor label, query in questions:\n    print(f\"\\n--- {label} Question ---\")\n    print(f\"Q: {query}\")\n    \n    # Retrieve relevant documents\n    docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)\n\n    # Print top 3 retrieved document snippets\n    print(\"\\nTop Retrieved Documents:\")\n    for i, doc in enumerate(docs[:3], start=1):\n        snippet = doc.page_content.strip().replace(\"\\n\", \" \")\n        print(f\"{i}. {snippet[:300]}{'...' if len(snippet) > 300 else ''}\")\n\n    # Build the prompt\n    context = \"\\n\".join([doc.page_content for doc in docs])\n    prompt = f\"\"\"Answer the following question using the context below.
