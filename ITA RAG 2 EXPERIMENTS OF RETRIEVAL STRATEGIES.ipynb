Martin's A Game of Thrones, the Night's Watch serves as a microcosm of the broader political and social tensions in Westeros. The Night's Watch is a group of men who have sworn to defend the Wall, a massive fortification that separates the Seven Kingdoms from the wild and dangerous lands beyond. The Night's Watch is made up of men who have forsaken their families and their past lives to serve as soldiers, policemen, and stewards.\n\nAt the beginning of the novel, we see Jon Snow, a young man who has joined the Night's Watch against his father's wishes. Jon is conflicted about his decision to join the Night's Watch, as he misses his family and his home in Winterfell. However, he is also proud of his decision, as he believes that he is doing the right thing by serving his country.\n\nAs Jon Snow and his companions travel north to the Wall, we see the harsh realities of life in the Seven Kingdoms. The people they encounter are poor and desperate, and many of them are willing to do anything to survive. This includes selling their children into slavery or joining the Night's Watch in order to escape poverty and hardship.\n\nOnce they reach the Wall, Jon Snow and his companions are introduced to the harsh realities of life as a member of the Night's Watch. The men they meet are tough, disciplined, and devoted to their duties. However, they are also deeply suspicious of outsiders, and they have little respect for Jon Snow and his companions.\n\nAs Jon Snow settles into his new life, we see the complex social and political dynamics that govern life in the Seven Kingdoms. The Night's Watch is a microcosm of the broader tensions between the North and the South, between the rich and the poor, and between those who are loyal to the crown and those who are not. We see this in the conflict between Lord Eddard Stark, the Lord of Winterfell, and King Robert Baratheon, who accuses Eddard of being disloyal to the crown.\n\nIn the appendix, we see the consequences of these tensions as the Night's Watch is called upon to defend the Wall against an invasion by wildlings, a group of savage and dangerous people who live beyond the Wall\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Step 6: Ask a question\nquery = \"Discuss the role of Hammad Khan in Convocation 2024\"\n\n# Step 7: Retrieve relevant documents\ndocs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)\n\n# Step 8: Build prompt using retrieved chunks\ncontext = \"\\n\".join([doc.page_content for doc in docs])\nprompt = f\"\"\"Answer the following question using the context below.

Lady Stoneheart plays a significant role in the story, leading a group of outlaws known as the Brotherhood Without Banners in their quest for revenge against those who wronged the Starks. She is a formidable character, and her appearance and demeanor are chilling, as she is depicted as having a stone-like face and a cold, unfeeling personality. Her presence adds to the complexity and intrigue of the series, as her actions and motivations are not always clear, and her allegiances are uncertain. She also serves as a symbol of the darkness\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":10},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"RAG USING HYBRID SEARCH WITH RRF","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain.schema import Document\nfrom langchain_community.retrievers import BM25Retriever\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, pipeline\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import FAISS\nfrom langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings\nfrom langchain.retrievers import EnsembleRetriever\n\n# Step 1: Chunk the text\ntext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(\n    chunk_size=1000,\n    chunk_overlap=200\n)\nchunks = text_splitter.split_text(raw_text)\n\n# Step 2: Convert to LangChain Documents\ndocuments = [Document(page_content=chunk) for chunk in chunks]\n\n# Step 3: BM25 Retriever\nbm25_retriever = BM25Retriever.from_documents(documents)\nbm25_retriever.k = 5\n\n# Step 4: Semantic Retriever (FAISS + MiniLM)\nembedding_model = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=\"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\")\nvectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(documents, embedding_model)\nsemantic_retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={\"k\": 5})\n\n# Step 5: Ensemble Retriever using RRF\nensemble_retriever = EnsembleRetriever(\n    retrievers=[bm25_retriever, semantic_retriever],\n    mode=\"reciprocal_rerank\"  # Enables RRF\n)\n\n# Step 6: Load Zephyr-7B\nmodel_id = \"HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_id,\n    device_map=\"auto\",\n    torch_dtype=\"auto\",\n    trust_remote_code=True\n)\n\n# Step 7: Create pipeline\ntext_gen = pipeline(\n    \"text-generation\",\n    model=model,\n    tokenizer=tokenizer,\n    max_new_tokens=512,\n    temperature=0.7,\n    top_p=0.9,\n    do_sample=True,\n)\n\n# Step 8: Question\nquery = \"What is the name of the sword used by Eddard Stark in the execution scene?\"\n\n# Step 9: Retrieve using RRF\ndocs = ensemble_retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)\n\n# Step 10: Build prompt\ncontext = \"\\n\".join([doc.page_content for doc in docs])\nprompt = f\"\"\"Answer the following question using the context below.

Their relationship is reflected in their interaction during the direwolf pup scene as they both show a strong bond and affection towards the pups.

This act of kindness and generosity highlights the closeness between the two brothers, who grew up together and have shared memories of playing and fighting with their direwolf pups. Jon's emotional response to the gift also shows the depth of his feelings towards Robb, whom he admires and respects as a true leader and hero. Overall, the scene demonstrates the strong familial bond between Jon and Robb, despite their illegitimate births.\n\n--- Advanced Question ---\nQ: Discuss the role of the Night’s Watch in the prologue and appendix, and how it serves as a microcosm of the broader political and social tensions in Westeros.\n\nTop Retrieved Documents:\n1. did yourself.” Lord Slynt’s jowls were quivering, but before he could frame a further protest Maester Aemon said, “Your Grace, by law a man’s past crimes and transgressions are wiped clean when he says his words and becomes a Sworn Brother of the Night’s Watch.” “I am aware of that.

Wind and words. We are only human, and the gods have fashioned us...\n\nA:  The Night’s Watch, a brotherhood sworn to defend the Wall against the Others, serves as a microcosm of the broader political and social tensions in Westeros in both the prologue and appendix. In the prologue, we are introduced to the Night’s Watch through the story of Qhorin Halfhand, a veteran of the Night’s Watch who has been captured by Mance Rayder, the king beyond the Wall. Qhorin is faced with a difficult decision: either die as a prisoner of Mance or reveal the location of the Nightfort, the abandoned fortress where Jon Snow, the son of Eddard Stark, has taken refuge. Qhorin chooses to sacrifice himself, hoping that Jon will be able to hold the Nightfort against Mance’s forces. This act of self-sacrifice reflects the Night’s Watch’s commitment to their vows and their duty to defend the Wall against the Others.\n\nHowever, the Night’s Watch is not just a group of men sworn to defend the Wall; it is also a microcosm of the broader political and social tensions in Westeros. The Night’s Watch is made up of men from different regions of Westeros, and this leads to conflicts and tensions within the brotherhood. In the prologue, we see that Qhorin is a Northerner, while Mance Rayder is a Wildling. This highlights the tension between the North and the South, as well as the tension between the Night’s Watch and the Wildlings. The Wildlings, who are forced to live beyond the Wall due to the harsh climate, are seen as barbarians by many in Westeros, including the Night’s Watch. However, Qhorin recognizes that the Wildlings are not all evil, and that some, like Mance Rayder, are fighting for a just cause.\n\nIn the appendix, we see that the Night’s Watch is also involved in the political tensions between the different houses in Westeros. Stannis Baratheon, who has been exiled by his brother, Robert Baratheon, seeks the aid of the Night’s Watch in his quest to reclaim the Iron Throne. However, the Night’s Watch is committed to remaining neutral in the conflicts of the Seven Kingdoms, as per their vows.
